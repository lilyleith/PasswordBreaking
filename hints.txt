Salt: Maximum of 5 digits

Leet: Start using the simple and most popular transformations (characters->numbers).
A leet transformation can be applied to parts of the string (e.g., only a->4) as well as to each character (if there is a valid mapping) individually. 


Caesar cipher: In the classical Caesar cipher, each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. This shifting is usually applied separately for uppercase and lowercase letters. Use the ASCII table to transform the given characters.
For simplicity, do not transform numbers or other special symbols.

Substitution cipher: The alphabet used for the substitution cipher is a shifted English alphabet. You need to think about how to map the English alphabet to the shifted alphabet. The encrypted text is a typical set of sentences, part of a larger text. You should be able to decrypt every word and form the sentences without changing punctuation.
