all the variety, all the charm, all the beauty of life is made up of light and shadow. the day that had been clear and bright began to cloud over; drops of rain began to fall. one by one, those around sought shelter, but there was a kind of quiet and peace in the sudden change. there is something calming in the acceptance of what comes, a resignation to the unexpected, that fills the heart with a new kind of awareness. the mind, too, like the world outside, shifts and changes, adapting to the new weather of thoughts and feelings. it is in these moments of transformation that one feels most alive, most aware of the depths and mysteries within.
